This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Flask, Flask-RESTful, and Flask-SocketIO.
It allows users to create or join game rooms using unique codes, enabling real-time multiplayer gameplay.
The game logic is managed with a Redis backend to track player moves and determine win conditions.
